# Tabletop

Tabletop is a simple and intuitive toy model experiment aimed to generate gravitational wave-like signals using a tabletop
system. The experimental setup consists of a circular solid frame with an elastic fabric stretched on its top, secured by clips,
solid spheres of different masses, a webcam and a laptop running the TableTopGW software. A heavy sphere is placed in the
middle of the stretched fabric in order to simulate an astrophysical compact object that curves the space around it. A lighter
sphere is allowed to inspiral on the surface of the curved fabric towards the massive central body. The webcam records the
positions of the two spheres at each moment. The separation between the spheres is determined and used together with the
quadrupole formalism of general relativity applied to binary systems in order to generate gravitational-like waveforms. A visual
connection is thus established between the physical motion of the two masses and the computer-generated waveforms.
